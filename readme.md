# Studio Rayfield
This is a port of [Rayfield](https://github.com/shlexware/Rayfield/tree/main) (UI library for Roblox exploits) with Roblox Studio compatibility and no key system.

Read the documentation [here](https://docs.sirius.menu/rayfield) (not mine)

## Note
I haven't tested every single feature so some of them may be broken.

Because local scripts don't support inserting Roblox models, I have added the model as a child of the script. Only copying the source code will give an error. Read below to import it correctly. 

## Where to get
The Roblox model has been taken down, you can only download the file: [Rayfield.rbxm](https://github.com/Epixerty/StudioRayfield/blob/main/Rayfield.rbxm)
